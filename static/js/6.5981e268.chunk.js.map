Born and brought up in this small city, my childhood was mostly peaceful. I was just another kid, big blurry dreams of who I’ll grow up to be, and I guess music just caught my eyes. Then I found rap. Gotta say, rap is one good way to get your thoughts out. Came to Chennai in 2016 to pursue B.Tech from SRM Chennai, where I met Noodl(Kshitij), and made our first song, Running the game, which was just a start to number of projects we have worked on together. In 2019, I got a chance to take part in REDBULL’s Spotlight, and won Chennai Spotlight, booking a place in final 10, which I can say was an amazing journey to learn from. Hope you all enjoy my music, and I’ll keep dropping bangers.\""],"sourceRoot":""}
